  //Because this is asynchronous, just like using fetch(), Apollo's @apollo/client library provides a loading property to indicate that the request isn't done just yet. When it's finished and we have data returned from the server, that information is stored in the destructured data property.

  //Optional chaining negates the need to check if an object even exists before accessing its properties. In this case, no data will exist until the query to the server is finished. So if we type data.thoughts, we'll receive an error saying we can't access the property of dataâ€”because it is undefined.
  //What we're saying is, if data exists, store it in the thoughts constant we just created. If data is undefined, then save an empty array to the thoughts component.
